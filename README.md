This is an emacs major mode for the Spacebars template language.
It is heavily based on jinja2-mode by paradoxxxzero available at
https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/jinja2-mode.

Like jinja2-mode, spacebars-mode includes:
* syntax highlighting
* sgml/html integration
* indentation (working with sgml)
